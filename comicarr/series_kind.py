"""Deep module answering which provider owns a Series and where its chapters come from.

Series identity is encoded two ways that must be read together:

  * the ``ComicID`` prefix (``md-`` MangaDex, ``mal-`` MyAnimeList, otherwise
    ComicVine), which says who issued the id, and
  * the ``ContentType`` column, which says whether the Series is manga at all.

They can disagree. A manga row added before the provider prefixes existed
carries ``ContentType == 'manga'`` with an unprefixed ComicID, so a caller that
consults only the prefix will treat it as a comic. Reconciling the two is what
:func:`is_manga` is for; every caller should ask it rather than testing either
signal directly.

The load-bearing invariant is that **MyAnimeList supplies metadata but MangaDex
always supplies chapters**. A MAL-sourced Series therefore fetches chapters
against the MangaDex uuid recorded in its ``MangaDexID`` column, not against its
own ComicID. :func:`chapter_source_id` is the only place that rule is written
down.

This module imports nothing from Comicarr so that it can be imported from both
the legacy business modules and ``comicarr.app`` without cycles.
